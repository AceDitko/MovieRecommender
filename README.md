# MovieRecommender
The beginnings of a movie recommendation engine purely based on data obtained by the author's ratings of 100 new movies each year. 
This project is unstable, mainly used as a learning tool, and honestly a bit of a mess. 
I am currently attempting to package this model to begin first attempts at deployment.
